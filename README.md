# Pet Portal: A Face-Verification-System-for-Pets

This is a face verification System, exclusively trained for pets. The Model uses one shot learning "where one, or a few, examples are used to classify many new examples in the future". Given the data intensive aspect of general classification algorithms, this is particularly useful in training face recognition models. 
The system incorporates led lights, ultra-sonic sound sensors, web camera, a step-up motor connected to an Arduino Uno board. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of the pet from the door and blinks green when an object is at a certain distance away. The green light triggers the webcam which uses machine learning algorithms to check if the object's image exists in the database. If so, the step-up motor rotates to open the door allowing access to the pet.
